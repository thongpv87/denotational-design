Dear Conal,

> I’m sorry for taking so long to respond. I was working on a paper deadline, and I also didn’t quite know how to reply, and then I’m afraid I forgot.

Thank you for getting back to me. Please don't worry about the delayed response, I completely understand that you were busy with a paper deadline. Congratulations on your new paper! When it is published, I would love to read it or watch your talk about it. I also don't have much time to work on the subject.

> It looks like you’ve progressed enough that we can get back on track with correct engineering based founded on elegant (precise & simple) specifications. Do you have any inclinations for puzzles you’d like to play with, either specifically or a general flavor?

Unfortunately, I am currently facing some financial difficulties and may need to prioritize finding a job before continuing my research in this subject. So I may need to spend time more to practice skills that are relevant to the interviews. However, I want to stress that I am still interested in denotational design and plan to return to it once I got a job.

I also have this opinions in mind. Is denotation design is *all* about finding a precise algebraic structure for the domain and map it to codomain via homomorphisms? The domain are usually problems that we would like to solve using computer such as doing linear algebra, image manipulation, ... and the codomain is ultimately machine code. We can also have other options such as presented in "compiling to categories" paper.

> Also ask how you can shift effort and cleverness from the question (lemma) to the answer (proof) so as to minimize the unproved footprint of your work and to move yourself more into the Tao.

You mentioned this in an email in the past. I'm not very understanding it. But since you mention Taoism, I think *duality* in mathematics is very similar to Yin and Yang. 


I truly appreciate the time and effort you've put into educating me on denotational design. Your insights have really opened my mind and have been immensely helpful. I apologize for not being able to devote enough time to the research and for possibly disappointing you. I do hope to return to the subject as soon as I can.

Sincerely,

Thông
