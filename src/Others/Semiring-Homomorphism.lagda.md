## Semiring
- Two monoid: `(M, ⊕, 0)` and `(M, ⊗, 1)`
- `(M, ⊕, 0)` is a communicative monoid
- `(M, ⊗, 1)` is a monoid
- `⊕` left & right distribute over `⊗`
- `M ⊗ 0 = 0 = 0 ⊗ M`

## Currying and Uncurrying semiring homomorphism?

### Currying
`curry : (A × B → C) → (A → B → C)`
`uncurry: (A → B → C) → (A × B → C)`
