<p>Dear Conal,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you are trying to argue that the existence of a raw monoid
homomorphism from a (law-abiding) monoid does not imply that the
homomorphism’s target obeys the monoid laws. Am I accurately
understanding the nature of your claim?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that’s exactly what I was trying to prove.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the shape of your argument here (leading to the third bullet
point above) is that if P ⇒ Q then ¬ P ⇒ ¬ Q, which you probably realize
is not generally valid. (Not all sufficient conditions are necessary
conditions.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for pointed that out. Now I see the error with my
proof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your claim above somehow related to a purpose you see being served
by including the Monoid constraints in the MonoidH class (and similarly
for CommMonoidH)?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In your CommMonoidH class, what purpose is served by
the P-comm, comm-monoidₘ and comm-monoidₙ fields? In other words, what
value would be lost if you eliminated them? Likewise, in
your MonoidH class, what purpose is served by the third and fourth
fields (monoidₘ and monoidₙ)?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you asked <em>“what value would be lost if you eliminated
them?”</em>, I want to show that without <code>Monoid</code> constraints
in <code>MonoidH</code> or similarly with <code>CommMonoidH</code>, the
homomorphisms would <em>not</em> be the morphisms that preserve
(monoid/communicative monoid) structure. That’s why I need to include it
in the definition of those homomorphisms.</p>
<p>I apologize if there was any confusion caused by my misunderstanding
of your request or if my English is not clear. As a non-native speaker,
I sometimes or struggle to express myself clearly in writing.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Thong</p>
