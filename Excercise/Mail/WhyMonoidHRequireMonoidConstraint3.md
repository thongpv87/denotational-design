Dear Conal,

Thank you for your email.

> So you think homomorphisms need to preserve laws—in addition to preserving (distributing over) operations, and thus something that doesn’t preserve laws couldn’t be a homomorphism. I’d like you to reflect on a few questions and share your thoughts with me:

I think homomorphism, as definition, is a structure-preserving map between *two algebraic structures* of the *same type*, so:

  - Its domain and codomain *must* be the *same* algebraic structure, such as from `Monoid → Monoid`, `Ring → Ring`.
  - *It preserves (distributing over) operations*
  - Actually, I think laws preserving is property of homomorphism. Although, logically it equals to *thus something that doesn’t preserve laws couldn’t be a homomorphism.* 
  - However, I *think* *preserve laws* is *consequence* of defining the homomorphism between the same algebraic structure and preserves operation. I don't know if there is evidence for this, it's just my intuitive.

> Do you know how you came to this perspective?

I haven't learn much of abstract algebra. I've spent about 3-4 months to study Bartosz Milewski's course and his book Category Theory for Programmers. The book do mention homomorphism but not very carefully, so I only remember from the book that it preserve structure and it can be seen as morphisms between object in category. Ex: monoid homomorphism is morphism in monoid category where object are monoids. So other info that I mentioned above is just my own interpretations for the knowledge about homomorphism.

> What would be lost if you let homomorphisms preserve operations and not laws?

As I mentioned, I *think* laws preserving is consequence of preserve operation between same type of algebraic structure. So preserves operations *implies* preserves laws. If we can prove this, there is nothing lost. 

Otherwise, if there is homomorphism that only preserve operation and the laws can be violated, *manipulate* object in domain category and then map it via homomorphism would give different results if we *mapped* via homomorphism before *manipulate* it in codomain.

> What would be gained?

I don't have answer for this question

> I asked for clarification not because your communication was unclear but rather because there is always ambiguity in conversation, so I like to take care with checking my interpretations.

I see. Thank you.

> I hope you don’t sense any disappointment, frustration, or reprimand in my responses.

No, I don't feel that at all. I said that because of I always worry of about taking up too much of your valuable time.

> If it’s okay with you, let’s arrange a video chat sometime soon to help us make more of a personal connection. I think you’ll find me gentle and encouraging.

That sounds great. I am also looking forward to making a more personal connection through a video chat. If it's okay with you, please let me know a day and time that works for you, and I will make sure to be available. Please note that I am unavailable between 5 PM and 1 AM GMT.

Best regards,
