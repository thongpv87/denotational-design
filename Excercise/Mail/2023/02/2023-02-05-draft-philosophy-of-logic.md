Dear Conal,

I've been thinking about philosophy aspects of logic recently. I found it's interesting to think about it so I just want to share with you about it.

Following thoughts that I'm going to share with you can be seen as a methodology to think about purpose of our life, planing plan for our life, ...

We can think that a person may have a set of truths, which he postulates to be true. It's like the axiom set in a logic or mathematics theory. The truths in this set are arbitrary for each person, other people may think that some of the truths are wrong but that doesn't matter. To he/she, those are the right things.

An example of a person's "axiom" set could be like this:
  1. I have right to have freedom 
  2. I have right to plan my children's life 
  3. I have right to be treated as I treat other
  4. I have 500 USD in my bank acount
  5. I have right that my health protected
  6. I have right that my honor protected
  7. I'm single, 28 years old

Actions of a person could do are theorems derived from this axiom. So the proposition has this form: `TruthAxiom â†’ Action`. If the proposition is proved, which mean he/she would think that it's right to do that.

For example, if a man's axiom set is only I have right to have freedom, then he may think that it's right to do whatever he wants. He may not wears mask during COVID pandemic, fabricating fake news about others. From his point of view, those are the right things to do.

Other woman may have different axiom set, such as 1, 3, 5. So she may spread fake news about others, but she would wears mask during the pandemic. Because:
  - `(3, 5)` implies she has responsible to protect health of other people
  - `Not wearing mask` implies she may spread the virus to other people
  - That lead to contradiction
  - That mean she need wears mask

A goal of life can be seen as a proposition that take `TruthAxiom` and some or many other parameters. For example: I want my son to study engineering in university when I am 40. Assume that I have `(1, 2, 3, 7)` as axiom set, that goals could be proved as following
- `(1, 3)` implies that the son has right to choose his own university, that implies that I have no right to force him learn study of engineering
- `my son` implies
  - I have to get married and having son with my wife and get him to university of engineering
    - Since `7` implies that when I am 40, the son will be at most 12 years old. He can not get in to university of engineering at that age.
  - I have to adopt a son, and he need to be at the age around
- Since we already proved that I have no right to force the son to learn study of engineering, it's necessarily that the son I adopted son also want to going to university of engineering

*Our life can be seen as a journey of archiving our goals of life. The goals are propositions, our life is evaluation of the proof for the propositions*. 

I'm not sure how to build a good axiom set, but I think it should be minimal and having no contradiction in the axiom set. 

Each person may have a different axiom set. In a society such as a family, group of friends, a country, ... if there are more people having similar axiom set, there would be less conflict between people. *It's worth noting that some good goals may not archivable or some bad situation may happen if people don't agree on some statements*. For example, as a civilization and we want our children to survive on the planet, we must agree that nuclear war is wrong, damage environment is wrong.
